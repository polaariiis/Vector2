# Vector Math (C++ Practice)

This repository contains a simple **Vector2D implementation in C++**, created as part of my learning process while studying **C++ classes, memory basics, and object-oriented design**.

The goal of this project is not to be a full math library, but to **practice clean class design, correctness, and core vector operations**.

## Features

- 2D vector representation
- Vector addition
- Dot product
- Cross product (2D scalar)
- Normalization
- Scalar multiplication
- Const-correct methods
- Safe handling of edge cases (e.g. zero-length vectors)

## Motivation

This project was written to:
- reinforce C++ fundamentals
- understand class design and responsibility
- practice passing objects by reference
- prepare for more advanced topics like inheritance, virtual functions, and engine-level math usage

---

## Technologies

- Language: **C++**
- Standard Library: `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`

---

## Current Status

- Vector2D implementation is complete
- Code is functional and readable
- Further extensions planned:
  - operator overloading
  - non-mutating operations
  - Vector3D
  - design experiments with inheritance (for learning purposes)

## Disclaimer

This project is for **learning and experimentation**.  
Design choices may evolve as my understanding of C++ deepens.
